# Kernel_SVM

## Kernel Support Vector Machine (Kernel SVM)
_Kernel SVM is an extension of the standard Support Vector Machine that uses kernel functions to handle non-linear decision boundaries. It allows SVM to work in cases where the data is not linearly separable in its original feature space by projecting it into a higher-dimensional space._

## Why Kernel SVM?
+ Standard SVM can only draw linear hyperplanes, which limits its use for linearly separable data.
+ Kernel SVM enables the algorithm to find a decision boundary in higher dimensions without explicitly computing new features, making it efficient and powerful for non-linear problems.
